# EZModz
This tool, is a revolutionary tool that makes it easy, and I mean very easy to install mods to the minecraft launcher or others.
You simply pick what your mod source is, then type the exact name of your mod like "Iris Shaders" or anything, then type your minecraft version, your loader, and BOOM it saves the mod! It will then check for required mods such as "Sodium" or "Fabric API" and asks you if you would like to install that too. This is written in PowerShell and the default windows Batch format.
